IMPORTANT API Change for 1.1.x users - as of GeoIP 1.1.0 the
lookupCountryXxxx methods return null if a country can not
be found (it used to return '--' or 'N/A'.  Be sure to check the
return value for null !

This is version 1.1.4 of the Java interface to GeoIP.  For more information
see http://www.maxmind.com/

As of version 1.1.4 this API is fully thread safe.
